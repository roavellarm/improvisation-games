    text: `The games described below were created in 2020 based on the games used in my master's study. At the time they were thought of, the world was experiencing the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, when contact and physical presence became difficult due to sanitary and epidemiological conditions. The intention of these activities is to maintain some of the possible aspects of collective teaching of musical instruments, even at a distance, with the help of digital technologies. For its application, I suggest each teacher to create, with students, a virtual exchange environment, such as a message group, in which students share their creations, experiences and discoveries, for example. I hope that the world does not have to go through new phases of isolation and that these activities can be used in other moments of distance or face-to-face teaching and learning.`,

Add sounds that happen inside the house, sounds that come from neighbors, from windows, from the streets. Record the inventoried sounds in audio or video. Choose three sounds and create a way to play them on your instrument. It doesn't have to be a literal reproduction, but it must make sense to whoever created it. Record the three sounds created with the cello. Send the created sounds to a colleague. Each student is tasked with discovering which original sound inspired their colleague. While the student who received the recording does not discover what the original sound is, who created it sends "clues" until the colleague identifies it. In advance, establish how much time will be allocated for discovering the sound of the colleague, before sending a new track, and so on.`,

Each person must record, with their instrument, at least three small videos or audios with sounds that represent the place where they live. These sounds can be sounds from the house or surroundings. The teacher receives these videos or audios, creates a link on some social media and attaches the link to the map, in the place where that person lives.
