      'The term contemporary music, widely used by performers, teachers and students of music, still lacks a precise definition since one of the problematics that involves the use of this term is the idea that it would be intended to define all and any music produced nowadays. To help us to define what commonly called in academia by contemporary music, we resorted to the conceptions of the professor Bernardete Zagonel. The professor elucidates that, in those circles, the expression often used to refer to the European classical music of the XX and XXI centuries, which has been aesthetically oriented by profound philosophical, scientific, cultural and technological changes that have taken place during this period. When we are willing to listen to and appreciate contemporary music, we must detach ourselves from old paradigms and open our perceptions to understand and apprehend other forms of musical expression. So, contemporary music can be defined as the music production connected to classical music, linked to the artistic proposals formulated from the twentieth century on and marked by the complexities of various artistic, cultural and philosophical references.',

However, since the last century distincts musicians, composers, educators and instrument teacher, seek to embody this repertoire and sound possibilities to the practices of students. As an example of these initiatives, we can mention the works of Béla Bartók and Boris Porena, as also of the brazilians Heitor Villa-Lobos, Ernest Mahle and Bruno Kiefer.',

      'The insertion of the contemporary music repertoire in the instrument classes continues to be reduced and poorly publicized. The low acceptance of this repertoire in the concert halls across the country may also raise doubts about the importance of its application, mainly among students of beginner levels. We must comprehend that the application of proposals related to the poetics of contemporary music brings students closer to the conceptions and thought of their own time, especially when these proposals are linked to activities of creation, such as what happens in the practices of improvisation. By using the term “poetic” to refer to contemporary music, we come close to a conception that sees music not only as language but as an artistic expression grounded on the philosophical, aesthetic, historical, social and political conceptions of its surroundings and, even in biographical elements of artists. This term, used since antiquity by the Greek philosopher Aristotle, to refer to literary works, has been adopted in contemporaneity to refer to other artistic manifestations, such as the visual arts, the performing arts and music, referring to everything that is produced making deliberate use of an aesthetic composition.',

      'Through the proposals of contemporary music that involve improvisation, we bring the creation into the instrument classrooms and bring the art of everyday life closer, and the "music- thought", as the poet Augusto de Campos called it, from the day to day of students/ performers. Currently, "music-thought", or "invention music", as it is sometimes named, seems to be aimed at a minimal part of the population that has access to specialized music education. Thus, the openness to different musical manifestations, which are understood as socio-cultural phenomena, seems to be conditioned to factors of a social and economic nature, undemocratic and not very inclusive. In Brazil, musical education in specialized schools, frequently is intended almost exclusively to investigate and reproduce repertoires from centuries before the 20th and 21st centuries. Thereby, the student tends to perform only works of the past, developing neither his creative power nor his critical and reflective capacity. In the main Brazilian concert halls, the musical presentation also seems to be addressed often to the appreciation of historical character, being the idea of art as a promoter of critical thinking and reflection undervalued.',

      'Improvisation is a practice that has developed over the centuries and in different ways in many cultures, such as Indian, Arab and Persian cultures, among others. In European cultures, this practice was common until the middle of the 19th century, when the roles of composer and performer began to be outlined as self-excluding. The practice of improvisation continued to be addressed, generally in the midst of popular music, in styles such as jazz, choro, salsa, in artistic manifestations known as "free improvisation", as well as in pieces by composers of contemporary poetics that, sometimes, earmark passages to performers\' improvisation.',

      'Since the mid-twentieth century, the practice of improvisation has also proven to be an important pedagogical strategy for the teaching of music. However, this practice is rarely applied in musical instrument classes, according to the researcher Chefa Alonso, with the exception of the Nordic countries. Understanding the importance of activities related to improvisation and some proposals for the use of this practice helps us, as teachers, to elaborate concepts where this is included in the planned activities for our classes. Researchers and music educators emphasize in their work and reports that, through activities related to improvisation, it is possible to present the musical contents to students, while music becomes a vehicle for the expression of perceptions, thoughts and feelings.',

      'Since the work of researcher Derek Bailey, which dates back to 1993, improvisation began to be classified according to some characteristics related to his idiom. Although the use of these terms has been relativized by the researcher who defined them, they are still widely used. It is called "idiomatic improvisation" which is linked to a specific style or musical "language" and "non-idiomatic improvisation" which does not relate to a particular language, but to sound, with its possible relations and transformations. Among the practices related to "non-idiomatics" is also the "free improvisation," which encompasses a series of manifestations that define themselves as such. In common, these practices develop a focus on performance, which includes, to a greater or lesser extent, an active and creative performance in real time. Musical educators, in most cases, address in their teaching and learning processes some elements of proposals linked to free improvisation.',

In parallel it began to be observed by musical educators that children naturally already improvise freely and that if this practice is stimulated, musical elements can be incorporated into their experiences and learning. The educators emphasize some of the benefits of improvisation, among them, the learning of new forms of interpersonal relationships based on equality, the deepening of the relationship with the instrument, the greater understanding of musical compositions, the need to solve problems that present themselves as similar to those of everyday life, the development of creativity, self-expression, self-esteem and autonomy.',

      "In our practice as teachers, we often find institutions where teaching takes place only in an individual way, or tutorial, and others where teaching takes place collectively. In Brazil, mostly collective education takes place in institutions or NGO's where the flow of students is constant and it is necessary to attend to a large number of students at the same time, while in free or conservatory schools, teaching is directed to a single person at a time.

In Brazil, it began to be embraced in the fifties of the twentieth century, and in the seventies, a great movement emerged for the collective teaching of stroke strings, headed by Alberto Jaffé and Dayse de Luca. After the dissemination of the collective teaching instrument, researchers began to investigate the benefits of such teaching method, benefits that, in addition to musicals, are psychological and social in nature.',

In addition to these values, the musical practice collectively provides greater diversification of musical contents approached as they include some variables that are impossible in individual teaching. It is worth mentioning that collective education should not be a copy of individual education, only directed to more people at the same time. One of the features of the collective teaching is that the students must be busy during the entire class. To do so, the teacher's performance should also be differentiated, able to gather all students in function of the proposed objectives. The gaming improvisation practices offered on this paper are only possible within this context, given that they are directed to the collective learning of the instrument in association with the objectives and conceptions of this process.",

      "The educator, researcher and composer François Delalande, member of the French group GRM, founded by Pierre Schaeffer in 1951, dedicated to concrete and electroacoustic music, through intense research with children, points out that, commonly, when starting to study a musical instrument, students have a similar posture to the composer of concrete music, in other words, the exploratory need with expressive purposes of the sound bodies, in our case, the cello. As teachers, we can observe this need in the student's natural tendency to impact, scrape, stroke and produce different actions with different sound results. We can also observe that children and teens, in the initial phase of the study of the cello, do not have aesthetic prejudices such as those presented by students or musicians more technically advanced. Beginner students accept the cello as an infinite possibility of producing different music, with its aesthetic multiplicity. Such observation leads us to the conclusion that the difficulties of understanding contemporary music by professional musicians is a difficulty posed by the systematic repetition of certain musical styles, generally those belonging to European concert music of the 18th and 19th centuries.",

      'Thus, it can be concluded that one of the ways to start teaching the contemporary music repertoire and improvisation games is to allow the student to exercise his natural curiosity in exploring the sounds of the surroundings, among them, the sounds that can be produced by the cello. In doing so, we can use some ideas from some composers of contemporary music, such as the narrative, soundscape and mimesis. A mimesis is a resource used by different artistic languages, including music. In music, themimesisbasically consists of the imitation of environmental or psychological phenomena through the qualities of sound and the construction of musical narratives.',

      'During the cello exploration, the mimesis can also be used as a pedagogical resource. The several sounds produced by the cello can be related, along with the students, to psychological and environmental contents. Such approach provides students with the understanding that the sounds produced by the extended techniques, i.e., unconventional ways of approaching the instrument, are not only noises, but an important part of the expressive musical range, and students start to produce musical content increasingly subjective, encompassing both conventional techniques and extended techniques. In such way, they are able to express their thoughts, feelings and emotions through musical ideas.',

It is important that we name the techniques that already have a name defined by the literature, such as con legno, sul ponticelo, pizzicato Bartók. It is also important for us to make room for students to discover their own sounds, dedicating a part of this exploration to them so they can explore their instruments on their own.
